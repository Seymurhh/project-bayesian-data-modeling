## **Energy Efficiency Analysis in Buildings**

This repository presents an exploratory analysis and modeling approach to evaluate energy efficiency in buildings, specifically targeting the heating and cooling loads. The project utilizes the UCI Energy Efficiency dataset to identify significant predictors influencing energy consumption, applying regression analysis and Bayesian modeling techniques.

Project Goals:

Quantify the effects of various building design parameters on heating and cooling loads.

Identify statistically significant variables impacting energy efficiency.

Provide actionable insights to enhance architectural design and energy optimization.

Key Analytical Steps:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Regression analysis (Linear and Bayesian methods)

Variable transformations and interaction term modeling

Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) analysis to address multicollinearity

Dataset:

UCI Energy Efficiency dataset, available at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/242/energy+efficiency

Technologies and Tools:

Python (pandas, numpy, scipy)

Statsmodels, PyMC, ArviZ for statistical modeling

Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization

Setup and Usage:

Detailed implementation instructions and analyses are provided in the included Jupyter notebook.
